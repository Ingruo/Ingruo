Hi, I’m @Ingruo

Currently starting to get familiar with git hub and starting the first projects.
I gathered a bit of experience in python and in general programming at school.
Through my job I am involved in programmable logic controllers, so overall a good foundation to start learning new languages and creating interesting projects.
